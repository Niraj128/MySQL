Alter is to alter the structure of the table (schema)

ALTER TABLE employee DROP COLUMN jobtiltle ;

ALTER TABLE employee MODIFY COLUMN firstname VARCHAR(30);

ALTER TABLE employee DROP PRIMARY KEY;

ALTER TABLE employee ADD PRIMARY KEY (id);


DDL VS DML
==============
DDL - DATA DEFINITION LANGUAGE
- Deals with table structure

CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE


DML - DATA MANIPULATION LANGUAGE
- Deal with the DATA directly

INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE


TRUNCATE TABLE employee;
- TRUNCATE also remove all the records - DDL
- TRUNCATE internally drops the TABLE and recretae it.
